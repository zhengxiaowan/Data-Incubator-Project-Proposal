FIGURE 1:

This figure gives insight on job popularity and trends, particularly for Data Scientist.

The first plot shows the top 20 popular positions in 2011-2016. 
To get insight on Data Scientist position, analytics is done using all jobs and one of the top 20 popular positions (Computer Programmer) as reference.

The second plot shows that Data Scientist position has a more prominent increase compared to average. Computer Programmer position first increased as average from 2011 to 2014. However, it started to decline after 2014. Interesting, this is the time when Data Scientist increased even more steeply, which may indicate some Computer Programmer position has changed to other programming-related positions, such as Data Scientist.

Plot 3: 
Mean wage didn't have clear increasing or decreasing trend. Data Scientist mean wage increased after 2011 and declined back to the level of 2011 in 2016. This is interesting and worth exploring the reason given that the demand of Data Scientist position has increased like crazy. On the other hand, although Computer Programmer's demand decreases, its mean wage increases steadily from 2012 to 2016. It is also worth digging into the steep wage drop from 2011 to 2012 for Computer Programmer.
